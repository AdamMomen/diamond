Diamond is an interesting project, the best way to frame is learn about about blockchain and solidity. Remove the expecation as it's the one and only project that I'm working towards

### Get Comfortable w/ Diamond
1. Play with Diamond in sandbox environment develope a smart contract figure out what's going one
2. Chart Out Fairmint Diamond Smart Contract, meaning what are the things we want to store on chain?
    - Transactions
        - Issuance
        - Convertibles
        - Warrnats
        - Equity Compensations
    - Objects
        - Stakeholder
        - StockClass
        - Issuers

### Lesson Learnt from OCPv1
1. Transactions gasfees are expensive ~/Tx due to storing alot of data. 
2. OCP should include human readable information like issuer &  stakeholder names 
    -- why? Easier for investors to see their equity onchain? we should an application on top to know that. Is this necessary? comparison with cost?
3.
